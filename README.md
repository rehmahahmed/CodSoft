# CodSoft
All CodSoft internship tasks

Python Internship:
1) To-do List
Created by using tkinter module.
As per the specifications given by codsoft, the program will add a task on clicking submit button, allow user to edit a task on clicking edit button and delete a task on clicking the delete button.
I have tried my best to give it the same look and feel as specified by codsoft with colors and widget placing.
