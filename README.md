AI Internship:
1) Chatbot
Created using re, random, sys module.
This chatbot works with the help of predefined prompts and responses.
The main working of this code is that when prompted a query/sentence it searches all the predefined prompts and checks which one has highest matching precentage. After checking all prompts and evaluating which one has the maximum matching words it prints the respond defined to it.
This chatbot can reply to basic queries like hi, how are you and what did you eat today?
If encountered with some query that does not match with any predefined prompts the unknown function handles it with some responses.
The chatbot can also exit and end program if told to exit.

2) Tic Tac Toe Game
Created using tkinter and implemeting the minimax algorithm.
The game works via tkinter buttons that are originally set to display " ", but are updated when player clicks on them and computer plays its turn.
The minimax algorithm checks all base conditions first, then calls itself recursively by alternating the is_maximizing parameter's value.
The find_best_move function checks all conditions and returns the best move, this makes the computer unbeatable.
On completion of the game a messagebox is displayed that informs 'you won' or 'computer won' or 'its a tie' then resets the board for another match.
