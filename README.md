AI Internship:
1) Chatbot
Created using re, random, sys module.
This chatbot works with the help of predefined prompts and responses.
The main working of this code is that when prompted a query/sentence it searches all the predefined prompts and checks which one has highest matching precentage. After checking all prompts and evaluating which one has the maximum matching words it prints the respond defined to it.
This chatbot can reply to basic queries like hi, how are you and what did you eat today?
If encountered with some query that does not match with any predefined prompts the unknown function handles it with some responses.
The chatbot can also exit and end program if told to exit.
